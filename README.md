### About meðŸ§‘:
I am a web developer who is just starting to branch out. <br />
I completed the Java developer course at ezen Computer Academy.<br />
However, I was very interested in other languages, so I taught myself several languages, including Java, nodejs, react, and php.<br />
I will become a developer who always works hard.
